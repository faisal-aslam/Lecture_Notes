\section{Introduction to Space Complexity}

So far, we have focused on \textbf{time complexity}. Today, we will explore \textbf{space complexity}, which measures the memory resources
an algorithm uses. Space complexity is important for two key reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It quantifies the \textbf{memory consumption} of an algorithm.
    \item If two algorithms have the \textbf{same time complexity}, but one uses more space, the latter may run slower due to higher memory overhead.
\end{enumerate}

We will only consider space complexity for \textbf{decidable Turing Machines (TMs)}, meaning they halt on all inputs. 
With this in mind, let's formally define space complexity.

\section{Space Complexity Definitions}

\subsection{1. Deterministic Turing Machines (DTM)}
The \textbf{space complexity} of a decidable deterministic TM is a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \), where \( f(n) \) is 
the \textbf{maximum number of tape cells visited} by the TM on any input of size \( n \).

\subsection{2. Non-Deterministic Turing Machines (NTM)}
The \textbf{space complexity} of a decidable non-deterministic TM is a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \), 
where \( f(n) \) is the \textbf{maximum number of tape cells visited} by the TM \textbf{along any computational branch} for any input of size \( n \).

\section{Clarifying the Notion of ``Visited'' in Space Complexity}

To properly analyze space complexity, we must precisely define what constitutes a ``visited'' tape cell:

\begin{definition}[Visited Cell]
A tape cell is considered \textbf{visited} if the Turing Machine's read/write head ever occupies or scans that cell during computation. Each distinct cell visited contributes exactly one unit to the space complexity, regardless of how many times it is accessed.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Contrast with Time Complexity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity} counts only the \textit{number of distinct cells} ever accessed during computation. Multiple accesses to the same cell do not increase the space measure.

    \item \textbf{Time Complexity} counts the \textit{total number of transitions} executed by the TM. Each basic operation (read, write, move, state change) constitutes one transition, regardless of whether it involves previously accessed cells.

%    \item \textbf{Configuration vs Transition}: While a configuration (complete state snapshot including tape contents, head position, and control state) is useful for decidability proofs, time complexity specifically counts transitions between configurations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Implications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Space complexity depends only on the \textit{maximum workspace} needed, not on how frequently cells are reused.

    \item Time complexity depends on the \textit{total computation length}, counting every transition, including repeated operations on the same cells.

    \item This distinction explains why some problems can have different space and time complexity classes (e.g., problems in $\text{PSPACE}$ but not $\text{P}$).
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
Consider a TM that writes $n$ bits by repeatedly moving back-and-forth across $O(1)$ cells:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Its \textit{space complexity} is $O(1)$ (fixed number of cells)
    \item Its \textit{time complexity} is $\Omega(n)$ ($n$ transitions needed)
\end{itemize}
\end{example}


\section{Complexity Classes for Space}

We now define some fundamental classes of space complexity:

\subsection{SPACE(\( f(n) \))}
\[
\text{SPACE}(f(n)) = \{ B \mid \text{some deterministic 1-tape TM } M \text{ decides } B \text{ using } O(f(n)) \text{ space} \}
\]
A more precise name for this class is \textbf{DSPACE(\( f(n) \))}, but we will use the conventional notation.

\subsection{NSPACE(\( f(n) \))}
\[
\text{NSPACE}(f(n)) = \{ B \mid \text{some non-deterministic 1-tape TM } M \text{ decides } B \text{ using } O(f(n)) \text{ space} \}
\]

\subsection{PSPACE}
\[
\text{PSPACE} = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \text{SPACE}(n^k)
\]
Thus, PSPACE contains all languages decidable by a deterministic TM using \textbf{polynomial space}.

\subsection{NPSPACE}
\[
\text{NPSPACE} = \bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \text{NSPACE}(n^k)
\]
Thus, NPSPACE contains all languages decidable by a non-deterministic TM using \textbf{polynomial space}.

These classes help us categorize problems based on their \textbf{memory requirements} under deterministic and non-deterministic computation models.

\section{Space Complexity of Multitape Turing Machines}

\begin{definition}
For a $k$-tape Turing machine $M$, its \textbf{space complexity} is the function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ where $f(n)$ represents the 
maximum total number of distinct cells visited across \emph{all} tapes during $M$'s computation on any input of length $n$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Multitape to Single-Tape Simulation]
    Any $k$-tape Turing machine (TM) with space complexity $O(s(n))$ can be simulated by a single-tape TM with the same space complexity, 
    i.e., $O(s(n))$, with the space only increased by a constant factor. 
    This constant factor depends only on the number of tapes $k$, and not on the input size $n$.
\end{theorem}

    
\section{Relationship Between Time and Space Complexity}

\begin{theorem}[Time-Space Containment]
    For any space-constructible function $t(n) \geq n$:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\text{TIME}(t(n)) \subseteq \text{SPACE}(t(n))$ \\
        (A machine using $t(n)$ time can visit at most $t(n)$ tape cells, hence its space usage is bounded by $t(n)$.)
        
        \item $\text{SPACE}(t(n)) \subseteq \text{TIME}(2^{O(t(n))})$ \\
        (A machine using $t(n)$ space has at most $2^{O(t(n))}$ possible configurations, so it must halt within that many transitions if it halts at all.)
    
        \item Based on the first inclusion, we can conclude that:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $P \subseteq PSPACE$
            \item $EXPTIME \subseteq EXPSPACE$
            \item $NP \subseteq NPSPACE$
        \end{itemize}
    
        \item Based on the second inclusion, we can conclude that:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $PSPACE \subseteq EXPTIME$
            \item $NPSPACE \subseteq EXPTIME$ \\
            (Because by Savitchâ€™s theorem, $NPSPACE = PSPACE$, so the same time bound applies.)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Explanation of the Containments}

\begin{description}
    \item[Time Bounds Space:] 
    Each transition of a TM can access at most one new tape cell. Therefore, a machine that halts after $O(t(n))$ transitions cannot use more than $O(t(n))$ space:
    \[
    \text{TIME}(t(n)) \subseteq \text{SPACE}(t(n))
    \]
    
    \item[Space Bounds Time via Configurations:]
    For a TM using $O(t(n))$ space:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let $Q$ be the set of states ($|Q|$ constant)
        \item Let $\Gamma$ be the tape alphabet ($|\Gamma|$ constant)
        \item Number of head positions: $O(t(n))$
        \item Number of possible tape contents: $|\Gamma|^{O(t(n))} = 2^{O(t(n))}$
    \end{itemize}
    Thus, the total number of distinct configurations is:
    \[
    |Q| \times O(t(n)) \times 2^{O(t(n))} = 2^{O(t(n))}
    \]
    
    Since the machine must halt (by decidability), it cannot execute more transitions than its number of possible configurations (otherwise it would repeat a configuration and loop forever). Therefore:
    \[
    \text{SPACE}(t(n)) \subseteq \text{TIME}(2^{O(t(n))})
    \]
\end{description}

\subsection{Key Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each transition corresponds to one unit of time complexity
    \item The configuration count ($2^{O(t(n))}$) provides an upper bound on possible distinct transitions before halting
    \item This explains why $\text{PSPACE} \subseteq \text{EXP}$ (problems solvable in polynomial space can require exponential time)
\end{itemize}

\section{Relationship Between NP and PSPACE}

\begin{theorem}
    $NP \subseteq PSPACE$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Proof that $SAT \in PSPACE$:}  
    Although $SAT$ is an NP-complete problem, it can be decided using polynomial space by trying all possible truth assignments sequentially without storing all of them simultaneously. We can evaluate each assignment one-by-one using only polynomial space, because storing a single assignment and checking the formula can be done within space proportional to the input size.

    \item \textbf{Proof that if $A \le_p B$ and $B \in PSPACE$, then $A \in PSPACE$:}  
    Suppose $f$ is a polynomial-time reduction from $A$ to $B$, and we have a polynomial-space algorithm for $B$. To decide if $x \in A$, we compute $f(x)$ (which requires only polynomial time, and hence polynomial space), and then decide whether $f(x) \in B$ using the polynomial-space algorithm for $B$. Thus, $A$ can be decided in polynomial space.

    \item \textbf{Conclusion:}  
    Every language $L \in NP$ is polynomial-time reducible to $SAT$ (since $SAT$ is NP-complete). By steps 1 and 2, and since polynomial-time reductions preserve membership in $PSPACE$, we conclude that $L \in PSPACE$. Hence, $NP \subseteq PSPACE$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem} $PSPACE = coPSPACE$\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    \subsection{Closure Under Complementation}

\begin{theorem}[PSPACE = coPSPACE]
The complexity class PSPACE is closed under complementation. That is:
\[
\text{PSPACE} = \text{coPSPACE}
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
For any language $L \in \text{PSPACE}$, let $M$ be a TM that decides $L$ using polynomial space. We can construct a machine $M'$ that decides $\overline{L}$ (the complement of $L$) as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $M'$ simulates $M$ using the same polynomial space bound $p(n)$
    \item When $M$ would accept, $M'$ rejects
    \item When $M$ would reject, $M'$ accepts
    \item $M'$ maintains the same space complexity since:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It uses exactly the same tape cells as $M$
        \item The finite control only needs constant additional space to track the inverted acceptance condition
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The key observations are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Space-bounded computation can be \textit{deterministically} complemented without increasing space usage
    \item Unlike time complexity, we don't need to worry about "timing out" - the space bound guarantees termination
    \item This fails for nondeterministic space classes unless Savitch's theorem gives us determinization (which it does for polynomial space)
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Contrast with Other Complexity Classes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Classes:} $\text{P} = \text{coP}$ (by similar argument), but it remains unknown whether $\text{NP} = \text{coNP}$
    \item \textbf{Logarithmic Space:} $\text{L} = \text{coL}$ (by SzelepcsÃ©nyi's theorem for NSPACE)
    \item \textbf{General Pattern:} Space-bounded classes tend to be closed under complementation, while time-bounded classes may not be
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Significance}
This property demonstrates an important advantage of space-bounded computation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Space resources can be \textit{reused} during computation
    \item There's no need to store computation history for complementation
    \item Contrast with time-bounded computation where complementation might require storing or recomputing information
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    $coNP \subseteq PSPACE$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fact:} It is known that $PSPACE = coPSPACE$, meaning the class of languages decidable in polynomial space is closed under 
    complementation.

    \item \textbf{Conclusion:}  
    Since $NP \subseteq PSPACE$, taking complements yields $coNP \subseteq coPSPACE = PSPACE$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
